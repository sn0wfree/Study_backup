#history 5 for QRM

##all
```{r all}
# history5.R
# a cleaned-up version that follows the outline of the lecture, if not the detail

#xx=read.table("clipboard",header=TRUE)
xx=read.csv("/Users/sn0wfree/Dropbox/PhD_1st_study/BST215_Quantitative_Research_Methods_Term_1/r_code/attendSLIM.csv",header=TRUE)
attach(xx)
head(xx)

xx[3,4] # third row, fourth column
xx[4,3] # fourth row, third column
xx[,3] # all of third column
xx[6,] # all of sixth row
xx[,6] # all of sixth column
xx[6] # all of sixth column; notice that this is the same result as the last line
      # notice also, that you CANNOT refer to the 6th row in this more economical way
#Alternatiely, because the 6th column is "year", we get the same results by typing:
year
year[2]  # this picks out second row in year; same result as:
xx[2,6]

# We can choose all data (that is, all columns) for all year 1 students and put it in Y1 by doing:

Y1= xx[year==1,]
#or
Y1=xx[xx[,6]==1,]   # I thought I was doing this in the class, but obviously not...
#or
Y1=xx[xx[6]==1,]

# similarly we could isolate subsets for Y2 and Y3
Y2=xx[xx[6]==2,]
Y3=xx[xx[6]==3,]

# Now, we wish to pick out just "termGPA", for instance, which is column 3
Ty1=xx[xx[6]==1,3]  # for year 1. The open-ended   ,] has becom a specific ,3]
Ty2=xx[xx[6]==2,3]  # for year 2
Ty3=xx[xx[6]==3,3]  # for year 3

t.test(Ty1,Ty2)
wilcox.test(Ty1,Ty2)

# ... and similarly for Ty1 versus Ty2; and Ty2 versus Ty3

# but firts, we should have done:
boxplot(Ty1,Ty2,Ty3)
# and even:
qqnorm(Ty1)
qqnorm(Ty2)
qqnorm(Ty3)

# three equivalent ways of finding out the numbers of students in each year
table(year)
table(xx[,6])
table(xx[6])

# Note, however, that that believing that
# year is interchangeably the same as xx[,6], and xx[6]
# is not necessarily the case.
# For instance, if we want breakdown of students who "pass" (with termGPA >=2)
# then these all work the same:

table(termGPA >=2, year)
table(xx[3] >= 2, year)
table(xx[3] >= 2, xx[,6])
table(xx[3] >= 2, xx[,6])


# BUT THESE DON'T:
#table(xx[3] >= 2, xx[6])
#table(xx[3,] >= 2, year)

#... and I don't know why...


```
